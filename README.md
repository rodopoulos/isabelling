# Isabelling

This repository is my personal collection of exercises, proofs and other experiments I'm carrying on Isabelle.

It is not intended to be an official repository for any of my proofs, but I hope it can bring some useful content to the community.

My ongoing master's heavily relies on Isabelle and formal verification theory, so I'm open to any suggestions and corrections in any of these scripts.
